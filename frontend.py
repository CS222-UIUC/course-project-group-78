Couldn't figure out how to connect Godot and Git yet. Have a basic UI up and running with
a main menu and gampelay scene. There are buttons you can click to switch between the two. 
Inlcuded button scripts below, don't know how to turn the whole project to code yet, will 
try to have that done by next week.
